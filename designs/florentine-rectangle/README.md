# Florentine Rectangles generated by CPro1
The parameters for each design are given in the filename, for example result-7-24-seed1000.txt has parameters (r,n) = (7,24).

The code progFR.c was generated by CPro1 using GPT-4o as the LLM, and was used to construct these designs.

It has no hyperparameters.

The commandline parameters are: instance-parameters seed

For example, after compiling progFR.c to progFR, result-7-24-seed1000.txt was produced by:

progFR 7 24 1000

The runs that generated these took up to 48 hours on a AMD Ryzen 9 7950X3D CPU.

These results were run under Ubuntu 24.4 with gcc 13.3.0 using glibc 2.39, compiled as follows:

gcc -march=native -O3 -o progFR progFR.c -lm
