# Covering Sequences generated by CPro1
The parameters for each design are given in the filename, for example result-9-1-71-seed1000.txt has parameters (n,R,L) = (9,1,71).
This problem comes from: Y.M. Chee et al. (2025). "Constructions of Covering Sequences and Arrays", arXiv:2502.08424v1.

The code progCS1.c and progCS2.c were generated by CPro1 using o3-mini-high as the LLM, and were used to construct these designs, as follows:
progCS1.c, with hyperparameters selected by hyperparameter tuning: [0.0, 98]
(all results not listed for progCS2.c below)

progCS2.c, with hyperparameters selected by hyperparameter tuning: [1, 12]
result-16-3-426-seed509000.txt
result-17-2-3938-seed279000.txt
result-17-3-795-seed519000.txt
result-18-2-7605-seed339000.txt
result-18-3-1481-seed279000.txt
result-19-2-14797-seed499000.txt
result-19-3-2734-seed469000.txt
result-20-3-5102-seed449000.txt

The commandline parameters are: instance-parameters seed hyperparameters

For example, after compiling progCS1.c to progCS1, result-9-1-71-seed1000.txt was produced by:
progCS1 9 1 71 1000 0.0 98

The runs that generated these took up to 48 hours on a AMD Ryzen 9 7950X3D CPU.

If you want to exactly reproduce the results of these runs, you'll generally need a compatible implementation of the random number generator.  These results were run under Ubuntu 24.4 with gcc 13.3.0 using glibc 2.39, compiled as follows:

gcc -march=native -O3 -o progCS1 progCS1.c -lm

Similar versions of gcc under Linux are likely to give similar results, but note that MacOS by default uses a different library with a different random number generator and won't give the same results.
