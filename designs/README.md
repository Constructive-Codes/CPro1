# Designs generated by CPro1

These directories have designs reported in the papers, and the CPro1-generated code that constructed the designs.
Each directory has one type of design, and the result-*.txt files in that directory are the constructed designs that resolve open instances of the existence problem for that type of design.

For designs where there are instances solved only with CPro1 using the reasoning model (o3-mini-high), all designs in that directory were constructed by code generated by o3-mini-high.  For symmetric-weighing-matrix and balanced-ternary-design, this means that the smaller set of designs generated by CPro1 with a non-reasoning model no longer appear in these directories; if you need those, they can be found in the v1.0-tagged version of this repository.
