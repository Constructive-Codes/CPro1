# Skew Weighing Matrix generated by CPro1
The parameters for the design are given in the filename; result-18-9-seed1000.txt has parameters (n,w) = (18,9).

The code progSkewW.c was generated by CPro1 using GPT-4o as the LLM, and was used to construct these designs.

The hyperparameters selected by hyperparameter tuning are: [3.2555811345715884, 1.0]

The commandline parameters are: instance-parameters seed hyperparameters

After compiling progSkewW.c to progSkewW, result-18-9-seed1000.txt was produced by:

progSkewW 18 9 1000 3.2555811345715884 1.0

The runs that generated these took up to 48 hours on a AMD Ryzen 9 7950X3D CPU.

If you want to exactly reproduce the results of these runs, you'll generally need a compatible implementation of the random number generator.  These results were run under Ubuntu 24.4 with gcc 13.3.0 using glibc 2.39, compiled as follows:

gcc -march=native -O3 -o progSkewW progSkewW.c -lm

Similar versions of gcc under Linux are likely to give similar results, but note that MacOS by default uses a different library with a different random number generator and won't give the same results.
