# Balanced Ternary Designs generated by CPro1
The parameters for each design are given in the filename, for example result-12-16-4-4-12-9-8-seed1000.txt has parameters (V,B;p1,p2,R;K,L) = (12,16;4,4,12;9,8).

The code progBTD.c was generated by CPro1 using GPT-4o as the LLM, and was used to construct these designs.
The hyperparameters selected by hyperparameter tuning are: [100, 0.9882906545854134, 1.0]
The commandline parameters are: instance-parameters seed hyperparameters
For example, after compiling progBTD.c to progBTD, result-12-16-4-4-12-9-8-seed1000.txt was produced by:
progBTD 12 16 4 4 12 9 8 1000 100 0.9882906545854134 1.0
The runs that generated these took up to 48 hours on a AMD Ryzen 9 7950X3D CPU.

If you want to exactly reproduce the results of these runs, you'll generally need a compatible implementation of the random number generator.
These results were run under Ubuntu 24.4 with gcc 13.3.0 using glibc 2.39, compiled as follows:
gcc -march=native -O3 -o progBTD progBTD.c -lm
Similar versions of gcc under Linux are likely to give similar results, but note that MacOS by default uses a different library with a different random number generator and won't give the same results.
