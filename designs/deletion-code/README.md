# Deletion Codes generated by CPro1
The parameters for each design are given in the filename, for example result-12-2-36-seed1000.txt has parameters (n,s,m) = (12,2,36).
This problem comes from: F. Weindel and R. Heckel (2025). "LLM-Guided Search for Deletion-Correcting Codes." arXiv:2504.00613v1.

The code progDC1.c and progDC2.c were generated by CPro1 using o3-mini-high as the LLM, and were used to construct these results, as follows:
progDC1.c, with hyperparameters selected by hyperparameter tuning: [7, 68], constructed all results except result-16-3-42-seed69000.txt.
progDC2.c, with no hyperparameters, constructed result-16-3-42-seed69000.txt.

The commandline parameters are: instance-parameters seed hyperparameters

For example, after compiling progDC1.c to progDC1, result-12-2-36-seed1000.txt was produced by:

progDC1 12 2 36 1000 7 68

The runs that generated these took up to 48 hours on a AMD Ryzen 9 7950X3D CPU.

If you want to exactly reproduce the results of these runs, you'll generally need a compatible implementation of the random number generator.  These results were run under Ubuntu 24.4 with gcc 13.3.0 using glibc 2.39, compiled as follows:

gcc -march=native -O3 -o progDC1 progDC1.c -lm

Similar versions of gcc under Linux are likely to give similar results, but note that MacOS by default uses a different library with a different random number generator and won't give the same results.
