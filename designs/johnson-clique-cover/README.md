# Johnson Clique Covers generated by CPro1
The parameters for each design are given in the filename, for example result-13-4-105-seed9000.txt has parameters (N,k,C) = (13,4,105).
See the problem_def.py for a description of the format of these files.
The format follows the one used in e.g. Table 3 of the original paper:
https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.15019
except type "A" here is represented by a "0" as the first number on the line, and type "B" is represented by a "1" as the first number on the line.

The code progJCC1.c and progJCC2.c were generated by CPro1 using o3-mini-high as the LLM, and were used to construct these designs, as follows:
progJCC1.c, with hyperparameters selected by hyperparameter tuning: [0.0012318175989068719]
result-13-4-105-seed9000.txt
result-14-4-138-seed89000.txt
result-15-4-177-seed9000.txt

progJCC2.c, with hyperparameters selected by hyperparameter tuning: [9971.137316488503, 1.0]
result-14-6-410-seed109000.txt
result-13-6-248-seed69000.txt

The commandline parameters are: instance-parameters seed hyperparameters

For example, after compiling progJCC2.c to progJCC2, result-13-6-248-seed69000.txt was produced by:

progJCC2 13 6 248 69000 9971.137316488503 1.0

The runs that generated these took up to 48 hours on a AMD Ryzen 9 7950X3D CPU.

If you want to exactly reproduce the results of these runs, you'll generally need a compatible implementation of the random number generator.  These results were run under Ubuntu 24.4 with gcc 13.3.0 using glibc 2.39, compiled as follows:

gcc -march=native -O3 -o progJCC2 progJCC2.c -lm

Similar versions of gcc under Linux are likely to give similar results, but note that MacOS by default uses a different library with a different random number generator and won't give the same results.
