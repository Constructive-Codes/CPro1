# Uniform Nested Steiner Quadruple System generated by CPro1
The parameters for the design are given in the filename: result-14-91-seed1000.txt has parameters (v,p) = (14,91).
Uniform Nested Steiner Quadruple Systems are defined in the publication: Y.M. Chee et al. (2025) Pairs in Nested Steiner Quadruple Systems, J. Combinatorial Designs 33(5):177-187.

The code progUNSQS.c was generated by CPro1 using o3-mini-high as the LLM, and was used to construct this design.

The hyperparameters selected by hyperparameter tuning are: [7, 1000.0, 0.011118517284498993]

The commandline parameters are: instance-parameters seed hyperparameters

So, after compiling progUNSQS.c to progUNSQS, result-14-91-seed1000.txt was produced by:

progUNSQS 14 91 1000 7 1000.0 0.011118517284498993

The runs that generated these took up to 48 hours on a AMD Ryzen 9 7950X3D CPU.

If you want to exactly reproduce the results of these runs, you'll generally need a compatible implementation of the random number generator.  These results were run under Ubuntu 24.4 with gcc 13.3.0 using glibc 2.39, compiled as follows:

gcc -march=native -O3 -o progUNSQS progUNSQS.c -lm

Similar versions of gcc under Linux are likely to give similar results, but note that MacOS by default uses a different library with a different random number generator and won't give the same results.
