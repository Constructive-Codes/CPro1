# Equidistant Permutation Array generated by CPro1
The parameters for the design are given in the filename: result-12-8-21-seed1000.txt has parameters (n,d,m) = (12,8,21).

The code progEPA.c was generated by CPro1 using GPT-4o as the LLM, and was used to construct these designs.

The hyperparameters selected by hyperparameter tuning are: [0.4444444444444444]

The commandline parameters are: instance-parameters seed hyperparameters

For example, after compiling progEPA.c to progEPA, result-12-8-21-seed1000.txt was produced by:

progEPA 12 8 21 1000 0.4444444444444444

The runs that generated these took up to 48 hours on a AMD Ryzen 9 7950X3D CPU.

If you want to exactly reproduce the results of these runs, you'll generally need a compatible implementation of the random number generator.  These results were run under Ubuntu 24.4 with gcc 13.3.0 using glibc 2.39, compiled as follows:

gcc -march=native -O3 -o progEPA progEPA.c -lm

Similar versions of gcc under Linux are likely to give similar results, but note that MacOS by default uses a different library with a different random number generator and won't give the same results.
